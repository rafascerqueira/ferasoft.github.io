      <p>
        I'm a full-stack developer, specialized in creating Backend with Node JS and Typescript, keeping clean and cohesive code to expand functionality and likely fixes. I usually apply some of the S.O.L.I.D. principles such as inversion of control and dependency injection in order to ensure that the project has a good build standard.
