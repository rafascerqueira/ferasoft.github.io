        I'm a full-stack developer, specialized in creating Backend with Node JS
        and Typescript, keeping clean and cohesive code to extend
        functionalities and probable fixes. I usually apply some of the
        S.O.L.I.D. principles such as inversion of control and dependency
        injection in order to ensure that the project has a good construction
        standard.

export { Home };
